/*
 * SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEM 2: DELETION GAMES
 *
 * Katniss and Peeta are tired of Hunger Games and want to play a new kind
 * of game instead, the Deletion Games! They want to sever all ties between
 * the Capitol and all of its districts (for the sake of this problem, assume
 * that there are actually NSLOTS districts). Katniss is severing ties
 * from the Capitol side, and Peeta is severing ties from the Districts' side.
 *
 * There is a 1:1 correspondence between capitol_slots and district_slots. This
 * means that each slot in capitol_slots has exactly one corresponding entry in
 * district_slots, and each slot in district_slots has exactly one corresponding
 * entry in capitol_slots. More formally:
 *
 * For all i in {0, 1, 2, ..., NSLOTS - 1},
 * if capitol_slot[i].is_mapped == true, then
 * district_slot[capitol_slot[i].district_index].is_mapped == true AND
 * district_slot[capitol_slot[i].district_index].capitol_index == i
 * AND similarly if district_slot[i].is_mapped == true.
 *
 * Katniss and Peeta each will use NTHREADS to delete these mappings. Katniss
 * will delete mappings based on randomly generated capitol indices, and Peeta
 * will delete mappings based on randomly generated district indices.
 *
 * For example, suppose Katniss randomly chooses capitol index 4 to delete.
 * She looks at capital slot 4, sees that the slot is still mapped, and finds
 * the corresponding district index is 12. Then Katniss will free the mappings
 * in capitol slot 4 and district slot 12.
 *
 * Suppose Peeta, on the other hand, randomly chooses district index 12 to
 * delete. He looks at district slot 12, sees that the slot is still mapped,
 * and finds the corresponding capitol index is 4. Then Peeta will free the
 * mappings in district slot 12 and capitol slot 4.
 *
 * However, without proper synchronization, we may get
 * - race conditions: if multiple threads attempt to delete the same mappings
 *   at the same time
 * - deadlock: Katniss and Peeta try to delete the (capitol 4, district 12)
 *   mappings at the same time starting from opposite sides.
 *
 * Your solution must satisfy these conditions:
 * - Avoid race conditions.
 * - Avoid any unsynchronized reads (reads on a shared variable without holding the mutex for that variable).
 * - No threads may exit until all the mappings have been deleted.
 * - Guarantee no deadlock can occur. Your invariants and comments should
 *   provide a convincing proof of this.
 *   HINT: You should insert well-placed thread_yield() calls in your code to
 *   convince yourself of no deadlock.
 * - When Katniss and Peeta generate random indices to delete, you may decide
 *   to IGNORE that index if you wish and move onto the next index. However,
 *   all mappings must eventually be deleted.
 *   HINT: Use this to your advantage to introduce some asymmetry to the
 *   problem.
 *
 * Here is an example of correct looking output:
...
