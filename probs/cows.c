/*
 * SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEM 1: SINGING COWS
 *
 * A cow has many children. Each baby cow puts on a performance by singing
 * lyrics to "Call Me Maybe." Like a good parent, the daddy cow must
 * sit through each one of its baby cow's performances until the end, in order
 * to say "Congratulations Baby N!" where N corresponds to the N-th baby cow.
 *
 * At any given moment, there is a single parent cow and possibly multiple
 * baby cows singing. The parent cow is not allowed to congratulate a baby
 * cow until that baby cow has finished singing. Your solution CANNOT
 * wait for ALL the cows to finish before starting to congratulate the babies.
 *
 * Here is an example of correct looking output:
...
Baby   1 Cow: Hot night, wind was blowin'
Baby   2 Cow: Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Baby   4 Cow: Don't ask me, I'll never tell
Baby   5 Cow: And this is crazy
Baby   8 Cow: Hot night, wind was blowin'
Parent   Cow: Congratulations Baby 7!
Baby   1 Cow: And now you're in my way
Baby   2 Cow: And now you're in my way
Baby   4 Cow: Hey, I just met you
Baby   5 Cow: Pennies and dimes for a kiss
Baby   8 Cow: But now you're in my way
Parent   Cow: Congratulations Baby 1!
Baby   2 Cow: Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Baby   4 Cow: I'd trade my soul for a wish
Baby   8 Cow: Hey, I just met you
Parent   Cow: Congratulations Baby 5!
Baby   2 Cow: Your stare was holdin'
Baby   4 Cow: But now you're in my way
Baby   8 Cow: Don't ask me, I'll never tell
Baby   2 Cow: Your stare was holdin'
Baby   4 Cow: Hot night, wind was blowin'
Baby   8 Cow: But now you're in my way
Baby   2 Cow: Your stare was holdin'
Baby   4 Cow: I'd trade my soul for a wish
Baby   8 Cow: But here's my number
Baby   2 Cow: Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Baby   4 Cow: But now you're in my way
Baby   8 Cow: But now you're in my way
Parent   Cow: Congratulations Baby 2!
Baby   4 Cow: Your stare was holdin'
Baby   8 Cow: Hey, I just met you
Baby   4 Cow: And this is crazy
Baby   8 Cow: I wasn't looking for this
