Grading scripts for cows and hunger games
=========================================

## Setup

Copy all the python files into the `cs161/root` directory:

    cp *.py path/to/cs161/root/

## Running the scripts

In the `cs161/root` directory:

    python check-cows.py
    python check-games.py

The output of sys161 will be placed in the specified
log files with the iteration number appended to the end.

Run these scripts with `--help` to see available options (e.g.
number of iterations to run, the timeout length to wait for
sys161 to finish, the log file base name, number of babies
for cows)
